//! The project roadmap: the per-project list of items the Roadmap tab renders.
//!
//! Layout mirrors the workflow module: [`types`] is the row and its enums,
//! [`store`] is the DAO (called with the connection lock held), and this file is
//! the typed `#[tauri::command]` surface plus the row-level events the frontend
//! syncs on.
//!
//! `roadmap_items` is deliberately absent from the generic CRUD allow-list
//! (`database::validate`), exactly like the `wf_*` tables. Codes must be
//! allocated under the connection lock, the `*_json` columns must be marshalled,
//! and every mutation must announce itself — a frontend `db_insert` would skip
//! all three.
//!
//! Events (all best-effort; a failed emit never affects what was persisted):
//! - `roadmap:item` — the full row, on every create/update. The frontend upserts
//!   by `id`, the same shape `wf:run` uses, so any writer (this surface, the PM
//!   agent's RPC, the queue drainer) updates the board without a refetch.
//! - `roadmap:item-deleted` — the deleted row's id, so the board drops it
//!   instead of upserting it.
//! - `roadmap:queue-note` — transient, from [`drainer`]: why a queued item isn't
//!   moving. Nothing persists it; see that module's docs for why.
//!
//! Autonomous dispatch lives in [`drainer`]: `queued` items become running
//! workflows there, and every mutation on this surface [`drainer::nudge`]s it so
//! a queue action doesn't wait out the tick interval.
